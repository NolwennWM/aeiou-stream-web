# aeiou multi-stream

Small multi-stream project coded for streaming between friends on self-hosted broadcasts.

The players are not mine.
They come from the repository [OvenPlayer](https://github.com/AirenSoft/OvenPlayer)

I only did the interface.
It can accept until 4 players at same time.
For more, it will need some CSS work.

## Installation

For add a player to the project, you need to complete the "Config.js" file.
